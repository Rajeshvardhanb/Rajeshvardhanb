## 👋 Overview

I am a **Senior DevSecOps Engineer** with **7+ years of experience** building and operating **production-grade cloud platforms**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **infrastructure, security, automation, and reliability**.

I focus on:
- Designing Kubernetes-first platforms
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- CI/CD systems that scale with teams
- Observability, cost control, and security by default

I am open to **senior engineering roles** and **consulting engagements**.

---

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

I believe DevSecOps is not a toolchain — it is a **culture of ownership**.

Well-designed platforms should be:
- **Secure by default**
- **Observable at every layer**
- **Automated end-to-end**
- **Cost-aware and resilient**
- **Easy for developers to use**
